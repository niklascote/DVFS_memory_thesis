Creating a microbenchmark which simulates wide range of memory behaviours.


How to use:
* Use Makefile to compile microbenchmark.c, command: make
* Execute pythonscript, command: python3 run_benchmark
* When execution is done, access memory-boundedness data in a new file called "output_microbenchmark.csv"
